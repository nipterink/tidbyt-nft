Ethereum and NFT Widgets for the Tidbyt

These widgets are built on top of the [Pixlet SDK](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet/) using Starlark scripts to display Ethereum and NFT data (from OpenSea) on the [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/). Instructions for how to run locally and deploy to the Tidbyt can be found on the [Pixlet Readme](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet/#readme).

Ethereum Price and Gas data is powered by https://etherchain.org/
OpenSea data is powered by their [API](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/api-overview).
